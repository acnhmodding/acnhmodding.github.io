MSBT (Message Binary Text) files are used in **Animal Crossing: New Horizons** to store text data, such as dialogue, item names, and other in-game text.

These files are stored in the `Message` folder of the `RomFS` and are named as `{file}_{language}.sarc.zs`, where `{file}` is the [File Name](#file-names) and `{language}` is the [Language Code](#language-codes).

In this guide you will learn how to install and setup **MSBT Editor** and how to use it to modify MSBT files.


## Installing MSBT Editor
**[MSBT Editor](/tools/msbt-editor)** is the primary tool used to edit MSBT files.

<Steps>
1. [Download the latest version of MSBT Editor](https://gitlab.com/AeonSake/msbt-editor/-/releases/permalink/latest) and [ACNH.gcf](https://gitlab.com/AeonSake/msbt-editor/-/blob/master/configs/ACNH.gcf). Both are updated frequently, so always check for updates!
2. Extract the zip file and open `MsbtEditor.exe` for the first time. It will generate the folder where you can put your `ACNH.gcf` file. 
3. Put `ACNH.gcf` inside the folder called `configs` (located next to `MsbtEditor.exe`) - **You don't need to close the editor!**
4. In the **MSBT Editor**, locate the `Data` drop-down menu (at the very top) and click on `Change Game Config`. It will pop-up a menu asking to *select a game config to use*, select `Animal Crossing: New Horizons` (you can click reload if it doesn't show in the list).
5. Your editor should be ready to use!
