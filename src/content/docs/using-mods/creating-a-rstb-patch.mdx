In this guide we'll be covering the steps for creating your own RSTB patch. This is necessary if you're suffering from crashes or items invisible in-game.

## Prerequisites
- [Heaven Tool](https://github.com/acnhmodding/HeavenTool/releases/latest)
- All the mods combined into a single `romfs` folder
- A vanilla `ResourceSizeTable.srsizetable` file. <a href="/downloads/ResourceSizeTable.srsizetable" download>Download it here</a>.

## Creating the Patch
<Steps>
1. Combine all of your mods into one "romfs" folder, make sure everything is where it should be.

    Example:
    <FileTree>
        - romfs/
            - Model/ Your model replacements go here
            - Bcsv/ 
            - EventFlow/
            - OtherFolders/
    </FileTree>

2. Open Heaven Tool and click "Open RSTB Editor."
3. Click "File" and then click "Open," then open a vanilla `ResourceSizeTable.srsizetable` file.
4. Now click "File" and click "Update from modded RomFs", then select your combined romfs folder that we made in step 1.
5. Save the file and make sure to name it `ResourceSizeTable.srsizetable`
6. If it asks you to compress the file, click "Yes."
7. In the `RomFs` folder we made in **Step 1**, create a folder called `System`, and `Resource` inside of it. Place our newly patched RSTB into that folder. If done correctly the location for this file should be: `romfs/System/Resource/ResourceSizeTable.srsizetable`
    
    **These folder and file names are CASE SENSITIVE, so make sure they are capitalized correctly.** If it asks you to replace an existing RSTB file, click yes.
8. You're ready! Just move/copy your `romfs` to the Switch or emulator and test in-game!
