4. Unzip the mod files you downloaded.
5. Transfer the mod files you downloaded to `atmosphere/contents/01006F8002326000/romFs`

Most mods needs a custom RSTB patch to work, most mods should work with the Universal RSTB, but if you are experiencing crashes or invisible items, you should create your own RSTB patch by following the [Creating a RSTB Patch](/using-mods/creating-a-rstb-patch) guide.
