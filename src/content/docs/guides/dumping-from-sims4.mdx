In this guide, we will cover how to dump models and textures from **The Sims 4** and add them into **Animal Crossing: New Horizons**. This process involves extracting `.package` files, converting them to a usable format, and then importing them into ACNH with **Switch Toolbox**.

## Requirements
- **The Sims 4** installed on your PC.
- [Sims 4 Studio](https://sims4studio.com/) to extract `.package` files.
- [Switch Toolbox](https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox/releases/latest) to convert and import files.
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) to edit and convert to `.dae`/`.fbx` format.

### Sims 4 Studio Setup
On your first time running **Sims 4 Studio**, you will need to set up the application by selecting your Sims 4 installation directory and other preferences.

<Steps>
1. **Creator Name**: Enter your name or a nickname.
2. **Sims 4 Path**: Browse to your Sims 4 installation directory.
3. **Sims 4 Documents**: Set the path to your Sims 4 documents folder (usually `Documents > Electronic Arts > The Sims 4`).
4. **Blender Directory**: Set the path to your Blender installation.
5. Save your settings.
</Steps>

## Dumping Model and Textures

<Steps>
1. **Open Sims 4 Studio**, check `Create 3d Mesh` (under `Object`) and click on the `Object` button.
2. It will open a window where you can search for the item you want to extract. You can use the search bar to find specific items.
3. Once you find the item, select it and click on `Next`.
4. It will ask you to save the `.package` file. Choose a location and save it.
    - We will not be using this file, so after saving you can safely delete it.

5. After saving, it will open the item in the editor. Here you can see the 3D model and textures.
6. In the `Textures` tab, export `Diffus` and `Normal` textures by clicking on them and hitting `Export`.
7. In the `Meshes` tab, export the 3d model. (as `.blend`)
8. Open the exported `.blend` file in **Blender**.
10. Now you can follow our guide on how to import models into ACNH using **Switch Toolbox**.
