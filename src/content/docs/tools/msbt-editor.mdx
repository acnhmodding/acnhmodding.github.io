The MSBT Editor is an open-source C# project created by [@AeonSake](https://gitlab.com/AeonSake), that provides a modern text editor for **MSBT** and **BMG** files. Style and functionality is heavily inspired by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and uses [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) as the base text editor.
