Welcome to **Animal-Crossing: New Horizons Modding Wiki**! 

Here you can learn how to use or create your own mods!

## FAQ 

<details>
<summary>Is there any risks on using mods?</summary>

In general, regardless of the safety of the mod, use mods online **at your own risk**. Using them offline, however, poses no risks. Most **Replacement Mods** are wifi-compatible. _Model Swaps_ will only show up for you, for others it will still appear as the vanilla item.
> If it's a **Replacement Mod** with `.bcsv` file(s), it is most likely **not** wifi-compatible.\
> If it's an **Addition Mod**, it's **definitely not** wifi-compatible because it relies on the `.bscv` edits, and will not work without it.

<details>
<summary>Should I use emuMMC or sysMMC?</summary>

If you're planning on going online, use sysMMC. EmuMMC online has a high likelihood of getting your console banned.

<summary>I have mods installed but I want to play online with friends, what should I do?</summary>

From your switch home screen, hold the _L button_ before launching ACNH. Continue to hold it until you see the palm tree loading icon and your game will load without any mods.

:::caution
If you have addition mods (non replacement custom items) this will remove them from your world!
